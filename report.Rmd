In this shiny test example I make a really simple regression of the mtcars data... Which i'm guessing you uploaded properly because It's not on the server:

```{r model, collapse=TRUE}
options(digits = 4)
fit <- lm(regFormula(), data = mtcars)
b   <- coef(fit)
summary(fit)
```

The fitting result is $mpg = `r b[1]` + `r b[2]``r input$x`$.
Below is a scatter plot with the regression line. Now look at that !!! Right ? I know !

```{r plot, fig.height=5}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
plot(regFormula(), data = mtcars, pch = 19, col = 'gray')
abline(fit, col = 'red', lwd = 2)
```

hope this was fun, I know this report means absolutely nothing but it means it's possible ... which s the whole poit ...
